if you have to code that you want to share:

codeToBeShared.c
- create a folder named inclues and add a new header file
codeToBeShared.h it should have the function definitions you want to share
- in the codeToBeShared.c source file include the header like source
#include <codeToBeShared.h>

- create an object file for the source code you want to share
gcc -Iinclues -c codeToBeShared.c codeToBeShared.o

- Now inside of the main file where this code to be shared is going to be used
#include <codeToBeShared.h>
- create an object file
gcc -Iincludes -c main.c -o main.o

- Now create an archive using the object file for the code you want to share
- libs is the destination the archive file should always begin with the prefex lib
ar -rcs ./libs/libcodetoshare.a codeToBeShared.o

- Finally you should be able to compile your main executable 
gcc main.o -llibs -lcodetoshare -o main.exe
